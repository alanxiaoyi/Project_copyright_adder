{"tagline":"Copyright Adder Tool","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"This tool is to use to add License header into source files. It is created under .NET framework 4.0 with Visual C#. I make this tool because recently I program a relatively large project for Linux machine and I want to add license info to those source files. I searched the web but found no satisfying tools(or shell scripts) with features I want. Since I am not good at shell programming and I want to learn something new in Windows, I decided to pick up visual C# and make this little tool. \r\n\r\nI learn a lot about the VS tool during the process and it's fun! Please help me improve the code. Thank you!\r\n","google":"","name":"Project Copyright Adder"}
